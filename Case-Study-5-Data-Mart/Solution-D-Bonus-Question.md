Looking at the result, sales made from Retail mostly experienced a significant decrease in the number of sales made for the 12 weeks before and after the period. We can also see that the first 3 rows from the result have decreased in sales by more than $50 million. From those 3 rows alone, we can see that sales from customers that is not regularly purchased Data Mart's products probably don't know about the new packaging. Meaning, there should be a new way to market our product to the occasional customers so they know about the changes Data Mart made to the products.
