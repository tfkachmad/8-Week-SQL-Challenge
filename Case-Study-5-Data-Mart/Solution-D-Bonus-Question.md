Output:

| ------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| SOUTH AMERICA | Shopify  | unknown  | unknown     | Existing      | 12,157                           | 6,808                           | -28.2%         |

The combination of these areas of business are creating the highest negative impact for the sales metrics performance in 2020 for the 12 week before and after period up to **-28.2%**.
The team can focus on these area to leverage their sales or reduce their attention from these areas to other areas that could generate more sales.
