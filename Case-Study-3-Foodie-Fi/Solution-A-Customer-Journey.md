1. Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the `subscriptions` table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey. Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!
    - The `subscription` table example:

        | customer_id | plan_id | start_date |
        | ----------- | ------- | ---------- |
        | 1           | 0       | 2020-08-01 |
        | 1           | 1       | 2020-08-08 |
        | 2           | 0       | 2020-09-20 |

    > All the customer started their journey using Foodie-Fi with the Trial plan. Some customers choose one of the three available plans, plan with plan_id with either 1 (basic monthly), 2 (pro monthly), or 3 (pro annual) after their trial plan ends. There are also customers that churned/canceled their subscriptions either after their trial plan ended or after a certain plan.
