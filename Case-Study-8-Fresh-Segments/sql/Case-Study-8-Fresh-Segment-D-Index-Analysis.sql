--  The index_value is a measure which can be used to reverse calculate the average
--  composition for Fresh Segmentsâ€™ clients.
--
--  Average composition can be calculated by dividing the composition column by the
--  index_value column rounded to 2 decimal places.

--  5. Provide a possible reason why the max average composition might change from month
--  to month? Could it signal something is not quite right with the overall business model
--  for Fresh Segments?

/*
    One possible reason based on the previous question is seasonal change.
    Based on the result, customer interaction on content related to travel/holiday
    is relatively higher than the other, especially during the holiday season or the
    end of the year. Because of this, the interaction on contents that are other than
    travel/holiday would be lower outside the holiday season.
