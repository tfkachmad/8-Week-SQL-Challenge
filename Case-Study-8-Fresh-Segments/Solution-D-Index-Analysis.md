# :orange: Case Study 8 - Fresh Segments: Solution D. Index Analysis

![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20By-SQL%20Server-%23CC2927?logo=microsoftsqlserver)

The `index_value` is a measure which can be used to reverse calculate the average composition for Fresh Segmentsâ€™ clients.

Average composition can be calculated by dividing the `composition` column by the `index_value` column rounded to 2 decimal places.

1. What is the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?

    - Create the average composition column

        Query:

        ```sql
        DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #new_interest_matrics;
        SELECT *, ROUND((CAST(composition AS float) / index_value), 2) AS average_composition
        INTO #new_interest_matrics
        FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics;
        ```

    - Finding the interests

        Query:

        ```sql
        WITH interest_CTE
        AS (
            SELECT interest_id
                ,new_month_year
                ,average_composition
                ,interest_name
                ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                    PARTITION BY new_month_year ORDER BY average_composition DESC
                    ) AS rn
            FROM #new_interest_matrics AS mat
            JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map AS map
                ON mat.interest_id = map.id
            WHERE new_month_year IS NOT NULL
            )
        SELECT new_month_year
            ,interest_name
            ,average_composition
        FROM interest_CTE
        WHERE rn BETWEEN 1
                AND 10;
        ```

        Example output for **2018-07-01**:

        | new_month_year | interest_name                 | average_composition |

2. For all of these top 10 interests - which interest appears the most often?

    Query:

    ```sql
    WITH interest_CTE
    AS (
        SELECT interest_id
            ,new_month_year
            ,average_composition
            ,CAST(interest_name AS VARCHAR) AS interest_name
            ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                PARTITION BY new_month_year ORDER BY average_composition DESC
                ) AS rn
        FROM #new_interest_matrics AS mat
        JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map AS map
            ON mat.interest_id = map.id
        WHERE new_month_year IS NOT NULL
        )
        ,top_interest_CTE
    AS (
        SELECT interest_id
            ,new_month_year
            ,interest_name
            ,average_composition
        FROM interest_CTE
        WHERE rn BETWEEN 1
                AND 10
        )
        ,ranking_CTE
    AS (
        SELECT interest_name
            ,COUNT(interest_name) AS appearance_cnt
            ,RANK() OVER (
                ORDER BY COUNT(interest_name) DESC
                ) AS rnk
        FROM top_interest_CTE
        GROUP BY interest_name
        )
    SELECT interest_name
        ,appearance_cnt
    FROM ranking_CTE
    WHERE rnk = 1;
    ```

    Output:

    | interest_name            | appearance_cnt |
    | ------------------------ | -------------- |
    | Solar Energy Researchers | 10             |

3. What is the average of the average composition for the top 10 interests for each month?

    Query:

    ```sql
    WITH interest_CTE
    AS (
        SELECT interest_id
            ,new_month_year
            ,average_composition
            ,interest_name
            ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                PARTITION BY new_month_year ORDER BY average_composition DESC
                ) AS rn

            ON mat.interest_id = map.id
        WHERE new_month_year IS NOT NULL
        )
    SELECT new_month_year
        ,ROUND((AVG(average_composition)), 2) AS average_composition_avg
    FROM interest_CTE
    WHERE rn BETWEEN 1
            AND 10
    GROUP BY new_month_year;
    ```

    Output:

5. Provide a possible reason why the max average composition might change from month to month? Could it signal something is not quite right with the overall business model for Fresh Segments?

    - One possible reason based on the previous question is seasonal change. Based on the result, the customer interaction on contents that related to travel/holiday are relatively higher than the other, especially on the holiday season or end of the year. Because of this, the interaction on contents that are other than travel/holiday would be lower outside the holiday season.
