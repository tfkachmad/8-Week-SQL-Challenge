# :orange: Case Study 8 - Fresh Segments: Solution D. Index Analysis

![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-4169e1?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)

The `index_value` is a measure which can be used to reverse calculate the average composition for Fresh Segmentsâ€™ clients.

Average composition can be calculated by dividing the `composition` column by the `index_value` column rounded to 2 decimal places.

1. What is the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?

    - Create the average composition column

        Query:

        ```sql
        SET search_path = 'fresh_segments';

        DROP TABLE IF EXISTS interest_metrics_comp;

        CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE interest_metrics_comp AS
        SELECT
            month_year,
            interest_id,
            composition,
            index_value,
            ROUND((composition / index_value)::NUMERIC, 2) AS composition_average,
            ranking,
            percentile_ranking
        FROM
            fresh_segments.interest_metrics
        WHERE
            month_year IS NOT NULL;
        ```

    - Finding the interests

        Query:

        ```sql
        WITH interest_ranking AS (
            SELECT
                month_year,
                interest_id,
                composition_average,
                ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY month_year ORDER BY composition_average DESC) AS interest_rank
            FROM
                interest_metrics_comp
        )
        SELECT
            i1.month_year,
            i2.interest_name,
            composition_average
        FROM
            interest_ranking AS i1
            JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map AS i2 ON i1.interest_id::INTEGER = i2.id
        WHERE
            interest_rank <= 10
        ORDER BY
            i1.month_year,
            i1.interest_rank;
        ```

        Example output for **2018-07-01**:

        | "month_year" | "interest_name"               | "composition_average" |
        |--------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|

        | 2018-07-01   | Work Comes First Travelers    | 4.80                  |
        | 2018-07-01   | HDTV Researchers              | 4.71                  |

2. For all of these top 10 interests - which interest appears the most often?

    Query:

    ```sql
    WITH interest_ranking AS (
        SELECT
            month_year,
            interest_id,
            composition_average,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY month_year ORDER BY composition_average DESC) AS interest_comp_rank
        FROM
            interest_metrics_comp
    ),
    top_interest AS (
        SELECT
            i2.interest_name,
            COUNT(*) AS count_total,
            RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS interest_rank
        FROM
            interest_ranking AS i1
            JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map AS i2 ON i1.interest_id::INTEGER = i2.id
        WHERE
            interest_comp_rank <= 10
        GROUP BY
            1
    )
    SELECT
        interest_name,
        count_total
    FROM
        top_interest
    WHERE
        interest_rank = 1;
    ```

    Output:

    | "interest_name"          | "count_total" |
    |--------------------------|---------------|
    | Solar Energy Researchers | 10            |
    | Alabama Trip Planners    | 10            |
    | Luxury Bedding Shoppers  | 10            |

3. What is the average of the average composition for the top 10 interests for each month?

    Query:

    ```sql
    WITH interest_ranking AS (
        SELECT
            month_year,
            composition_average,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY month_year ORDER BY composition_average DESC) AS interest_comp_rank
        FROM
            interest_metrics_comp
    )
    SELECT
        month_year,
        ROUND(AVG(composition_average), 2) AS average_composition_average
    FROM
        interest_ranking
    WHERE
        interest_comp_rank <= 10
    GROUP BY

5. Provide a possible reason why the max average composition might change from month to month? Could it signal something is not quite right with the overall business model for Fresh Segments?

    - One possible reason based on the previous question is seasonal change. Based on the result, customer interaction on content related to travel/holiday is relatively higher than the other, especially during the holiday season or the end of the year. Because of this, the interaction on contents that are other than travel/holiday would be lower outside the holiday season.
